To ensure that our functions appropriately change four $8$-component real vectors into a $32$-complement vector, they are first applied and then printed. 

For an arbitrary input vector, applying followed by the other yield our original input vector. The functions are then true inverses of one another.

The steps are as follows. First we define our arbitrary $8$-component vectors. Then, use m_vectors_to_v to the vector to get a $32$-component vector. This vector is printed as fed into v_to_m_vectors. The final output from v_to_m_vectors is our initial four $8$-component vectors.
