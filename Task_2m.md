In contrast to task 2l, the phase difference $\Phi_L - \Phi_R$ here is greater than zero. Since the supercurrent is proportional to the phase difference, it is to be expected that the current integrand $j(x,\varepsilon)>0$ when $\Phi_L-\Phi_R>0$.
From this plot we also see that the current varies with energy and that, when the phase difference is $1$, it switches direction at $\varepsilon=1$.
The current intagrand as a function of position is the same as the current density seen from a one-dimensional point of view. The current density is conserved, i.e. constant, for all positions because the Cooper pair at a certain $x$-coordinate need to move away to make space for a new Cooper pair to settle in that posiion. There cannot be any accumulation of Cooper pairs anywhere in the metal, and thus $j(x;\varepsilon)$ is constant.
