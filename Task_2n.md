We see the plot looking like a sinus function. When the phase angle $\phi$ is zero, there is no current between the superconductors. As the phase angle increases, the current becomes larger and larger in one direction, until it reaches its maximum at about $\frac{\pi}{4}$. As the phase angle grows further, the current slowly decreases, becomes zero at $\phi=\pi$, and starts to stream in the other direction. At about $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ it reaches its maximum the other way, and again decreases untuil the phase angle is back to $\phi=2\pi=0$.
