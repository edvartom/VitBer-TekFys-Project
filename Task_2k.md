The three plots we see here resemble figure $1$ in the project description if it were only plotted for positive energies, i.e. the plots are similar the right half of the symmetric function in figure $1$. The two key differences between the plots in this task (metal gaining superconductor properties) and the plot in figure $1$ (an actual superconductor) are the gap in the density of states and the bumps at $\varepsilon=1$. From now on, we will only consider energies $\varepsilon>0$, even though figure $1$ also includes density of states for negative energies.

According to figure $1$, a real superconductor would have a gap in the density of states for the energies $\varepsilon \in [0,1]$, where no electrons other than Cooper pairs can live. Since superconductor properties leak into the normal metal, it gets an equivalent gap, though smaller than that of a true superconductor. As we can see from the plots in this task, the minigap of the metal is located at approximately $\varepsilon \in [0,0.5]$ for $l=0.5$, $\varepsilon \in [0,0.15]$ for $l=1$, and $\varepsilon \in [0,0.05]$ for $l=2$. We conclude that the minigap shrinks with increasing $l$. This is likely because a longer piece of metal is less affected by the superconductors on either side. As we saw in the plot in task 2j, the closer one is to a superconductor, the more it affects the density of states $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$ within the normal metal. Thus, when the normal metal lies between two superconductors, $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$ is least affected in the middle of the metal, i.e. at $x=l/2$. As specified in the task, the density of states plotted here is what one finds at $x=l/2$ for different energies. It makes sense, therefore, that increasing the distance to both superconductors would make the metal less receptive to superconductor properties at that point.

In all three plots we also see a bump in the density of states at $\varepsilon=1$, where DOS momentarily increases before decreasing to even lower values than it had before the bump. For $l=2$, however, it seems to be the opposite; DOS decreases in $\varepsilon=1$ before slightly increasing again for higher energies. Considering that the bump for $l=2$ is so small and the change in the DOS-value so insignificant, one could possibly attribute this to rounding error. Still, the three plots show that the height (or depth) of the bump decreases with increasing $l$, which could again imply that this phenomenon has something to do with the proximity of superconductors. 
One possible explanation for the bumps could be that this is yet another underdeveloped superconductor property of the normal metal. From figure $1$ in the project description we see that the superconductor gap has a tall "wall" at $\varepsilon=1$. While the minigap in the normal metal has this wall at a lower energy, the bump at $\varepsilon=1$ could be some sort of residue, a weak trace of what should have been there had the metal been an actual superconductor. In the plots we also see that $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$ rapidly converges to $1$ (which is the density of states in a normal metal) after the bump. Therefore, the bump could also mark the minimum energy required to observe the Josephson effect.
