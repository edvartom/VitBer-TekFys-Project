The plot shows that the density of states $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0=1$ for all positions $x$ and energies $\varepsilon$. 
$D_0$ is defined as the density of states in a normal, non-superconducting metal. As there are no superconductivity involved in this task, one would expect $D(x,\varepsilon)=D_0$ for all positions and energies.

### Reformiulation

The figure shows the normalised DOS, as a function of position $x$. The DOS is normalised to the Fermi energy DOS $D_0 = D(E_F)$. In a normal metal, the DOS is spatially uniform. Since the task revolves around normal metal without superconducitivty, we expect $D(x, \varepsilon) = D_0$, $\ \forall x, \varepsilon$.
