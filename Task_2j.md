In this plot we see how the two superconductors on each side of the normal metal affect the density of states within the metal. The energy is set to $\varepsilon=2\frac{E-E_F}{\lvert \Delta \rvert}$, which is generally too high to observe superconducting properties in the normal metal, and we would expect $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$ to be around $1$ for all $x \in [0,l]$. Looking at the values on the $y$-axis in the plot, this seems to be the case. The values are only slightly lower than $1$, which could be a result of numerical rounding errors. 

However, the metal is not totally unaffected by the superconductors. The biggest difference between this plot and the plot in task 2h (where there were no superconductors present) is the shape of the graph. In 2h, $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$ is constantly equal to $1$ and forms a horizontal line, as expected. When the metals are switched out with superconductors, however, the graph bends and $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$ forms a parabola-like shape.

The reason for this shape can be found in figure $1$ in the project description. We see that for $\varepsilon=2\frac{E-E_F}{\lvert \Delta \rvert}$, a superconductor has a slightly higher density of states than a normal metal at the same energy. In order for the $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$-function to be continuous in the points where it passes from the left superconductor to the metal ($x=0$), and where it passes from the metal into th right superconductor ($x=l$), the $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$-function must have a slightly higher value in these points than in the middle of the metal. 

To summarize, a superconductor has a slightly higher density of states than a metal at $\varepsilon=2$. When a superconductor touches a metal, it forces the metal's $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$-function up near the interface for continuity. The closer one is to the interface, the more the superconductor affects the density of states in the metal. This explains why $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$ in the metal gets higher values close to the edges; the superconductors on either side of it drag it upward. The metal's density of states is the least affected in the middle ($x=l/2$) because it is the point furthest away from any superconductor, which also leads to this being a minima for $D(x,\varepsilon)/D_0$.
